# Project-RL-Grid-Attack
Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimal Load Shedding Mechanisms to Mitigate Load Alteration Attacks in Smart Grids
**********************************************************************************

Objectives of Proposed Research Work

(i) To implement a load alteration attack in the grid
A load alteration attack can be implemented in a smart grid environment by altering the
reported power consumption or the load data of certain consumers (e.g., homes, factories)
to make the grid management system react incorrectly. To implement a simulation
MATLAB-based environments have been used for creating a test grid and studying the
behaviour of the attack.
(ii) To mitigate a load alteration attack by Reinforcement learning
In the Reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the agent learns to make decisions by interacting
with an environment. In this case, the agent would learn to detect and mitigate the load
alteration attacks by observing the gridâ€™s frequency and adjusting the control policies
accordingly.
(iii) To develop a reward-based RL model
In the RL model, the agents will iteratively learn to stabilize the grid by minimizing the effects
of altered load data. This will be done through interaction with the environment and
receiving rewards based on performance (e.g., stabilizing the grid or detecting and
mitigating attacks).
